Hello!

My name is Neel Chudasama and this is my project on conducting Data Analysis on a bikeshare company with SQL.

In this project, I use SQL queries to dig into the dataset and explore the data at hand. The goal was to gain a high level understanding of how people use Bixi bikes, what factors influence usage, popular stations and growth. 

The data is a cleaned version of data downloaded from the open portal : https://www.bixi.com/en/open-data, however, for my task I used data from 2016 to 2017.


The files in this folder are: 
1. .sql file containing my queries and data analysis
